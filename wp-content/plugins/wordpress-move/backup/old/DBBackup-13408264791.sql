Their designs and products embody the Italian passion – capturing the finest details and made of the highest quality. They combine centuries-old craftsmanship with state-of-the-art lighting systems to deliver timeless, illuminated additions to one\'s life and home.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"> <a title=\"PrimoMaestro Italia\" href=\"http://primomaestro.com\" target=\"_blank\">VISIT SITE</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"intro\">CHALLENGE</div>\r\nPrimoMaestro Italia was looking to establish their brand presence and sell their products online in the US and internationally. They came to us with the desire to have a visually impactful brand and engaging website that would help increase their visibility in the marketplace and help generate leads and sales. Their vision was to target consumers as well as interior designers and architects who value and require luxurious and artful lighting. They wanted to create a premium online shopping experience, wrapped in the romance of the Italian culture.\r\n<div class=\"intro\">SOLUTION</div>\r\nIn order to set PrimoMaestro Italia apart from some of the more standard lighting companies, we approached the presentation of the lights in a way that supports the idea that each light is both functional and a work of art. So rather than simply grouping products into standard categories – table, floor, chandelier, we focused on featuring the various collections of lights as an art gallery would.\r\n\r\nWe developed the visual direction so that it was clear to visitors that this is a premium brand – focusing on highlighting the innovation, craftsmanship, and Italian origins. The design and overall look and feel would have to embody a clean and elegant style, with a smart balance of modern and classic elements.\r\n\r\nWe then applied the design and built a complete e-commerce shopping cart for both the English and Italian language websites. The website was built on a Content Management System that offers full online business capabilities – integrated shipping, payment gateways, email hosting, social media, reports and analytics, email marketing, CRM and contact form builder.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'PrimoMaestro Italia', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '1306-revision-10', '', '', '2012-05-21 17:32:59', '2012-05-21 21:32:59', '', '1306', 'http://getthepeople.com/1306-revision-10/', '0', 'revision', '', '0' ); ";i:502;s:285:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '84', '1', '2011-10-04 08:44:36', '2011-10-04 08:44:36', '', 'Blog', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'blog', '', '', '2012-05-07 23:37:00', '2012-05-07 23:37:00', '', '0', 'http://test.xhtmlchop.com/blog1503/?page_id=84', '0', 'page', '', '0' ); ";i:503;s:289:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '632', '1', '2012-02-02 08:45:30', '2012-02-02 08:45:30', '', 'Our Work', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'portfolio', '', '', '2012-05-07 20:13:10', '2012-05-07 20:13:10', '', '0', 'http://dev.okaythemes.com/slate/?page_id=632', '0', 'page', '', '0' ); ";i:504;s:294:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '995', '1', '2012-03-01 09:54:33', '2012-03-01 09:54:33', '', 'Social Dashboard', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'social', '', '', '2012-03-01 09:54:33', '2012-03-01 09:54:33', '', '0', 'http://dev.okaythemes.com/draft/?page_id=995', '0', 'page', '', '0' ); ";i:505;s:1542:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '1227', '1', '2012-05-04 18:39:48', '2012-05-04 18:39:48', 'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

The site has over 15,000 registered users and consists of hundreds of pages, custom articles, pre-designed goal templates and tens-of-thousands user-created goals.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a title=\"LifeSpace\" href=\"http://lifespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>VISIT SITE</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"intro\">CHALLENGE</div>\r\nA very small percentage of LifeSpace’s 15,000 registered users were actually returning to the site after their initial sign up. Additionally, the number of new registrations dropped off drastically after the site’s launch. LifeSpace was originally created on a custom-built platform with a patchwork of functionally and designed with no real brand identity or site strategy. The clear need was to make some serious changes for LifeSpace to become visually appealing, easy to use and on par with other member-based community websites.\r\n<div class=\"intro\">SOLUTION - Branding life and inspiration into how we achieve goals</div>\r\nLifeSpace needed LIFE. In order for LifeSpace to grow into a nationally and even internationally known application for creating and tracking goals it would need a total makeover and overhaul of the entire brand, site content, design and overall user experience.\r\n\r\nWe started by focusing on the brand development and creating a voice and visual identity that was fun, motivational and engaging. We accomplished this in a number of ways from creating a new logo, color schemes, custom graphics, fonts, buttons, calls-to-action, inspiring imagery, and consistent visual experience throughout the entire web application.\r\n\r\nThe next phase was to tackle what we felt was the largest issue, the flow and overall lack of organization of the content. We redesigned the entire flow and structure of the site from top to bottom, consolidating hundreds of pages of content, making it more dynamic, interactive, and intuitive to use.\r\n<h5>BRANDING</h5>\r\nWe organized the LifeSpace platform to focus on the main areas of a user’s life. We named and branded these ‘lifespaces’ by following an extensive process to create custom icons, color schemes and consistent imagery for each lifespace – bringing a visually inspirational component to the user experience.\r\n<h5>INTERNAL USER INTERFACE</h5>\r\nThe goal of the internal site was really showcase all the functionality of the website while keeping it simple and easy to use. We created a highly functioning, customizable, super powered dashboard we dubbed the SUERPAGE. It’s the one place where you can see, create, manage, track and share all your goals. We added a tab system so users can easily go from easy check lists, to calendar view, public discussions, and personal journal entries for each goal.\r\n<h5>COPY</h5>\r\nFresh copy writing was applied to the entire LifeSpace platform to truly communicate and reflect the new brand voice. We wrote the copy for the new external public website as well as the internal member-facing site to embody the new brand voice and identity.\r\n<h5>HOW IT WORKS TUTORIALS</h5>\r\nWe created a variety of fun and visual ‘How it Works’ presentations throughout the LifeSpace website. We felt it was important to create quick glance tutorials that would easily explain the power of what a user can accomplish with the online application.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>\"GetThePeople played a huge role in getting my company to the next level.  They took many complicated and disconnected ideas from a pre-existing platform and turned them into a visually engaging design and a highly intuitive workflow.\r\n\r\nThey stuck with the project all the way through and consistently brought passion, creativity and fun to an otherwise overwhelming process.

They wanted to create a premium online shopping experience, wrapped in the romance of the Italian culture.\r\n<div class=\"intro\">SOLUTION</div>\r\nIn order to set PrimoMaestro Italia apart from some of the more standard lighting companies, we approached the presentation of the lights in a way that supports the idea that each light is both functional and a work of art.

The design and overall look and feel would have to embody a clean and elegant style, with a smart balance of modern and classic elements.\r\n\r\nWe then applied the design and built a complete e-commerce shopping cart for both the English and Italian language websites.

They came to us with the desire to have a visually impactful brand and engaging website that would help increase their visibility in the marketplace and help generate leads and sales. Their vision was to target consumers as well as interior designers and architects who value and require luxurious and artful lighting. They wanted to create a premium online shopping experience, wrapped in the romance of the Italian culture.\r\n<div class=\"intro\">SOLUTION</div>\r\nIn order to set PrimoMaestro Italia apart from some of the more standard lighting companies, we approached the presentation of the lights in a way that supports the idea that each light is both functional and a work of art. So rather than simply grouping products into standard categories – table, floor, chandelier, we focused on featuring the various collections of lights as an art gallery would.\r\n\r\nWe developed the visual direction so that it was clear to visitors that this is a premium brand – focusing on highlighting the innovation, craftsmanship, and Italian origins. The design and overall look and feel would have to embody a clean and elegant style, with a smart balance of modern and classic elements.\r\n\r\nWe then applied the design and built a complete e-commerce shopping cart for both the English and Italian language websites. The website was built on a Content Management System that offers full online business capabilities – integrated shipping, payment gateways, email hosting, social media, reports and analytics, email marketing, CRM and contact form builder.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'PrimoMaestro Italia', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '1306-revision-11', '', '', '2012-06-26 18:06:31', '2012-06-26 22:06:31', '', '1306', 'http://getthepeople.com/1306-revision-11/', '0', 'revision', '', '0' ); ";i:566;s:299:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '1312', '1', '2012-05-04 19:09:08', '2012-05-04 19:09:08', '', 'PrimoMaestro Italia', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1306-revision', '', '', '2012-05-04 19:09:08', '2012-05-04 19:09:08', '', '1306', 'http://getthepeople.com/?p=1312', '0', 'revision', '', '0' ); ";i:567;s:568:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '1520', '1', '2012-05-23 16:12:28', '2012-05-23 20:12:28', '<a href=\"http://getthepeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GTP_Graf_11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1521\" title=\"GTP_Graf_1\" src=\"http://getthepeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GTP_Graf_11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"300\" /></a>', 'GTP Graffiti Slider', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'gtp-graffiti-slider', '', '', '2012-05-23 16:15:33', '2012-05-23 20:15:33', '', '0', 'http://getthepeople.com/?p=1520', '0', 'post', '', '0' ); ";i:568;s:291:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '1338', '1', '2012-05-04 19:08:35', '2012-05-04 19:08:35', '', 'LifeSpace', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1298-revision-2', '', '', '2012-05-04 19:08:35', '2012-05-04 19:08:35', '', '1298', 'http://getthepeople.com/?p=1338', '0', 'revision', '', '0' ); ";i:569;s:2183:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '1314', '1', '2012-05-04 19:21:11', '2012-05-04 19:21:11', '<strong>STRATEGY + BRANDING + LOGO DESIGN + WEBSITE  REDESIGN + CONTENT DEVELOPMENT + PRINT</strong>\r\n\r\nShe Creates Change empowers women to create a career where they are fully engaged in life, claim their calling, and make a meaningful contribution in the world.

The site has over 15,000 registered users and consists of hundreds of pages, custom articles, pre-designed goal templates and tens-of-thousands user-created goals.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a title=\"LifeSpace\" href=\"http://lifespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>VISIT SITE</strong></a></p>\n\n<div class=\"intro\">CHALLENGE</div>\nA very small percentage of LifeSpace’s 15,000 registered users were actually returning to the site after their initial sign up. Additionally, the number of new registrations dropped off drastically after the site’s launch. LifeSpace was originally created on a custom-built platform with a patchwork of functionally and designed with no real brand identity or site strategy. The clear need was to make some serious changes for LifeSpace to become visually appealing, easy to use and on par with other member-based community websites.\n<div class=\"intro\">SOLUTION - Branding life and inspiration into how we achieve goals</div>\nLifeSpace needed LIFE. In order for LifeSpace to grow into a nationally and even internationally known application for creating and tracking goals it would need a total makeover and overhaul of the entire brand, site content, design and overall user experience.\n\nWe started by focusing on the brand development and creating a voice and visual identity that was fun, motivational and engaging. We accomplished this in a number of ways from creating a new logo, color schemes, custom graphics, fonts, buttons, calls-to-action, inspiring imagery, and consistent visual experience throughout the entire web application.\n\nThe next phase was to tackle what we felt was the largest issue, the flow and overall lack of organization of the content.

A dozen years ago, GetThePeople was nothing more than a subway train conversation.

After years of visibility, the work graduated into a more graphic and strategic design application, finally transitioning into the lifelong dream - a creative design studio.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[uds-billboard name=\"GTP Graf\"]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'WHO WE ARE', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '1272-revision-89', '', '', '2012-05-24 13:21:24', '2012-05-24 17:21:24', '', '1272', 'http://getthepeople.com/1272-revision-89/', '0', 'revision', '', '0' ); ";i:715;s:305:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '1465', '1', '2012-05-07 21:21:33', '2012-05-07 21:21:33', '', 'Media Weapon', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '1421-revision-2', '', '', '2012-05-07 21:21:33', '2012-05-07 21:21:33', '', '1421', 'http://getthepeople.com/1421-revision-2/', '0', 'revision', '', '0' ); ";i:716;s:4723:"INSERT INTO wp_gtpposts VALUES( '1467', '1', '2012-05-07 22:30:08', '2012-05-07 22:30:08', '<strong>BRAND DEVELOPMENT + LOGO DESIGN + WEB REDESIGN + SITE ARCHITECTURE + CONTENT DEVELOPMENT + COPY WRITING + HOW IT WORKS TUTORIALS + EMAIL MARKETING </strong>\r\n\r\nLifeSpace is a membership-based online application that allows people to manage all their life’s goals in one place. The site has over 15,000 registered users and consists of hundreds of pages, custom articles, pre-designed goal templates and tens-of-thousands user-created goals.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a title=\"LifeSpace\" href=\"http://lifespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>VISIT SITE</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"intro\">CHALLENGE</div>\r\nA very small percentage of LifeSpace’s 15,000 registered users were actually returning to the site after their initial sign up. Additionally, the number of new registrations dropped off drastically after the site’s launch. LifeSpace was originally created on a custom-built platform with a patchwork of functionally and designed with no real brand identity or site strategy. The clear need was to make some serious changes for LifeSpace to become visually appealing, easy to use and on par with other member-based community websites.\r\n<div class=\"intro\">SOLUTION - Branding life and inspiration into how we achieve goals</div>\r\nLifeSpace needed LIFE. In order for LifeSpace to grow into a nationally and even internationally known application for creating and tracking goals it would need a total makeover and overhaul of the entire brand, site content, design and overall user experience.\r\n\r\nWe started by focusing on the brand development and creating a voice and visual identity that was fun, motivational and engaging. We accomplished this in a number of ways from creating a new logo, color schemes, custom graphics, fonts, buttons, calls-to-action, inspiring imagery, and consistent visual experience throughout the entire web application.\r\n\r\nThe next phase was to tackle what we felt was the largest issue, the flow and overall lack of organization of the content. We redesigned the entire flow and structure of the site from top to bottom, consolidating hundreds of pages of content, making it more dynamic, interactive, and intuitive to use.\r\n<h5>BRANDING</h5>\r\nWe organized the LifeSpace platform to focus on the main areas of a user’s life. We named and branded these ‘lifespaces’ by following an extensive process to create custom icons, color schemes and consistent imagery for each lifespace – bringing a visually inspirational component to the user experience.\r\n<h5>INTERNAL USER INTERFACE</h5>\r\nThe goal of the internal site was really showcase all the functionality of the website while keeping it simple and easy to use. We created a highly functioning, customizable, super powered dashboard we dubbed the SUERPAGE. It’s the one place where you can see, create, manage, track and share all your goals. We added a tab system so users can easily go from easy check lists, to calendar view, public discussions, and personal journal entries for each goal.\r\n<h5>COPY</h5>\r\nFresh copy writing was applied to the entire LifeSpace platform to truly communicate and reflect the new brand voice. We wrote the copy for the new external public website as well as the internal member-facing site to embody the new brand voice and identity.\r\n<h5>HOW IT WORKS TUTORIALS</h5>\r\nWe created a variety of fun and visual ‘How it Works’ presentations throughout the LifeSpace website. We felt it was important to create quick glance tutorials that would easily explain the power of what a user can accomplish with the online application.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>\"GetThePeople played a huge role in getting my company to the next level.  They took many complicated and disconnected ideas from a pre-existing platform and turned them into a visually engaging design and a highly intuitive workflow.\r\n\r\nThey stuck with the project all the way through and consistently brought passion, creativity and fun to an otherwise overwhelming process.

The site has over 15,000 registered users and consists of hundreds of pages, custom articles, pre-designed goal templates and tens-of-thousands user-created goals.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a title=\"LifeSpace\" href=\"http://lifespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>VISIT SITE</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"intro\">CHALLENGE</div>\r\nA very small percentage of LifeSpace’s 15,000 registered users were actually returning to the site after their initial sign up. Additionally, the number of new registrations dropped off drastically after the site’s launch. LifeSpace was originally created on a custom-built platform with a patchwork of functionally and designed with no real brand identity or site strategy. The clear need was to make some serious changes for LifeSpace to become visually appealing, easy to use and on par with other member-based community websites.\r\n<div class=\"intro\">SOLUTION - Branding life and inspiration into how we achieve goals</div>\r\nLifeSpace needed LIFE. In order for LifeSpace to grow into a nationally and even internationally known application for creating and tracking goals it would need a total makeover and overhaul of the entire brand, site content, design and overall user experience.\r\n\r\nWe started by focusing on the brand development and creating a voice and visual identity that was fun, motivational and engaging. We accomplished this in a number of ways from creating a new logo, color schemes, custom graphics, fonts, buttons, calls-to-action, inspiring imagery, and consistent visual experience throughout the entire web application.\r\n\r\nThe next phase was to tackle what we felt was the largest issue, the flow and overall lack of organization of the content. We redesigned the entire flow and structure of the site from top to bottom, consolidating hundreds of pages of content, making it more dynamic, interactive, and intuitive to use.\r\n<h5>BRANDING</h5>\r\nWe organized the LifeSpace platform to focus on the main areas of a user’s life. We named and branded these ‘lifespaces’ by following an extensive process to create custom icons, color schemes and consistent imagery for each lifespace – bringing a visually inspirational component to the user experience.\r\n<h5>INTERNAL USER INTERFACE</h5>\r\nThe goal of the internal site was really showcase all the functionality of the website while keeping it simple and easy to use. We created a highly functioning, customizable, super powered dashboard we dubbed the SUERPAGE. It’s the one place where you can see, create, manage, track and share all your goals. We added a tab system so users can easily go from easy check lists, to calendar view, public discussions, and personal journal entries for each goal.\r\n<h5>COPY</h5>\r\nFresh copy writing was applied to the entire LifeSpace platform to truly communicate and reflect the new brand voice. We wrote the copy for the new external public website as well as the internal member-facing site to embody the new brand voice and identity.\r\n<h5>HOW IT WORKS TUTORIALS</h5>\r\nWe created a variety of fun and visual ‘How it Works’ presentations throughout the LifeSpace website. We felt it was important to create quick glance tutorials that would easily explain the power of what a user can accomplish with the online application.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>\"GetThePeople played a huge role in getting my company to the next level.  They took many complicated and disconnected ideas from a pre-existing platform and turned them into a visually engaging design and a highly intuitive workflow.\r\n\r\nThey stuck with the project all the way through and consistently brought passion, creativity and fun to an otherwise overwhelming process.

The design and overall look and feel would have to embody a clean and elegant style, with a smart balance of modern and classic elements.\r\n\r\nWe then applied the design and built a complete e-commerce shopping cart for both the English and Italian language websites.

Whether it\'s pushing your brand to the next level, increasing sales, building relationships, or bringing a new business to market, pushing the edge with your website is your best chance at achieving your online goals.\r\n<h5>RELATED PROJECTS:<a title=\"LifeSpace\" href=\"http://getthepeople.com/lifespace\"> LifeSpace</a>, <a title=\"PrimoMaestro Italia\" href=\"http://getthepeople.com/primomaestro-italia/\">PrimoMaestro Italia</a>, <a title=\"She Creates Change\" href=\"http://getthepeople.com/she-creates-change/\">She Creates Change</a>,<a title=\"Nov8rix\" href=\"http://getthepeople.com/nov8rix/\"> Nov8rix</a>,  [/column]</h5>\r\n[column width=one-third-last ]\r\n<h2>CREATIVE STRATEGY</h2>\r\n<div class=\"intro\">Without a solid strategy your end result ends up patch work and afterthoughts.
